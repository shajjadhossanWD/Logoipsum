# React App

This is a simple React application created using the Create React App tool. It serves as a template for building React-based web applications.

## How the React App was created?

The React App was created using the following steps:

1. Install Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. Install Create React App: Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Create React App globally on your machine:

   ```
   npm install -g create-react-app
   ```

3. Create a new React App: Once Create React App is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to create your new React application and run the following command:

   ```
   npx create-react-app my-react-app
   ```

   This will create a new directory called `my-react-app` (you can replace it with the desired name of your application) and set up a basic React project structure inside it.

4. Navigate to the project directory: Change into the newly created project directory by running the following command:

   ```
   cd my-react-app
   ```

5. Start the development server: To start the development server and run the React application locally, use the following command:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will launch the development server and open your React application in a web browser. Any changes you make to the source code will be automatically reloaded in the browser.

## How to run the application?

To run the React application locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org) if you don't have it already.

2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

4. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

5. Start the development server by running the following command:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

6. After the development server starts, open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the React application running.

That's it! You now have the React application up and running on your local machine. You can explore and modify the code as needed to build your own React application.
